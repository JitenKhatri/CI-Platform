Community Investment Platform.

Employees are humans and humans are social. Social human beings have some social responsibility towards the society.
Employees of a company have responsibilities towards their professional life as well as social life.
This Community Investment Platform provides a one stop solution for a company to provide a way and encourage their Employees to 
fulfill their social responsibilities easily.
The companys can add campaigns as a form of missions with goals and also easy enroll functionality for the Employees.
The Employees can rate a campaign as well as write stories on experience of the campaign to encourage other Employees.
Writing comments and criticizing as well as praising the campaigns/missions is also a functionality managed by the system.

This CI Platform is made with the latest ASP.NET framework(6.0 at the time I was developing) with MVC architecture. 
It uses Entity framework to interact with real data. Has a beautiful responsive interface made with bootstrap.
Utilizes Jquery and its plugins to interact with REST Apis.
